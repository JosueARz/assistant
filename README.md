# Voice assistant
It is a simple program of a (virtual) voice assistant, to which I will be incorporating new functions, the main functions with their commands will be:

0- welcome (every time you start the program, it will start with a welcome and the exact time)

1- hour: time

2- date: date

3- search on wikipedia: wikipedia -- tell you want to search on wikipedia --

4- open a website: search on internet 

5- search something in google: search web-- tell something you want search--

6- play something in youtube: play youtube -- tell you want to play--

7- resume aoubt somthing: info -- tell that thing you want a resume--

8- close pc session: logout

9- shutdown pc: shutdown

10- restart pc: restart

11- save a reminder: remember

12- listen the reminder: tell me my reminders

13- take a screenshot: screenshot

14- cpu and battery nivels: pc info

15- listen a joke: tell me a joke

16- end assitant: bye

After the basic functions I will start a new program which will be a sentiment analyzer with machine learning, to later merge both programs, finally I will create another facial recognition program, also with machine learning, and I will add it to the virtual assistant, with the time I will be adding new functions.
